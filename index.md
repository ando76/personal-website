About Skinny Digital
---------------------

Hi, I'm Neil Anderson, owner of Skinny Digital.

Skinny Digital provides Front-end Digital Design and Development consultancy services for medium-to-large businesses and organisations in the UK. 

I have a long history in the industry and enjoy delivering transformational change in customer experience and visual design for clients. I'm a solid advocate of web accessibility and have over a decade of experience in this area. 

I'm also a specialist in refactoring and streamlining large, unwieldy HTML/CSS codebases. Sorting this aspect of your business out can give great boosts in productivity for your team as well as allowing you to scale your digital solutions fast.

I'm currently considering new projects for Q2 2015.
