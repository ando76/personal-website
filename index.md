About me
---------------------

Hi, I'm Neil Anderson and I'm a Consultant Front-end Digital Designer/Developer from the UK. 

I enjoy delivering transformational change in customer experience and visual design for medium-to-large businesses and organisations. I'm a solid advocate of web accessibility and have over a decade of experience in this area. 

I'm also a specialist in refactoring and streamlining large, unwieldy HTML/CSS codebases - this gives great boosts in productivity as well as allowing you to scale your digital solutions fast.
